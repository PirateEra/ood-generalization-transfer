    "text": "Just a win away from raising the UAAP Volleyball title for the fourth time in as many years, the De La Salle University Lady Spikers will try to bring the season to a close on Wednesday, March 12, but they face tough opposition in Ateneo de Manila University Lady Eagles, who are clinging to hopes of extending the series one more game.\n\nPlatoons of Blue and Green will head to the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay for Game 3 as the fabled rivalry of Ateneo and La Salle goes on, but advantage is leaning towards Taft Avenue after they completed their revenge against the Lady Eagles in Game 2 last weekend.\n\nAra Galang, who finished with 17 markers on Saturday, is expected to lead the La Salle crew once more with her Season 75 co-MVP Aby Marano, Mika Reyes and Cyd Demecillo providing the backing but newly-minted MVP Alyssa Valdez stands in their way as she will try to carry her squad one more time to set a sudden-death contest to decide the winner of the Season 76 trophy.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Ateneo will need Valdez to be in tip-top condition to keep La Salle on their toes but to win Game 3, Amy Ahomiro, Ella de Jesus, and the rest of the Lady Eagles must step up to make it easier for the league\ufffd\u0092s top scorer to pile up the points against a hardnosed Lady Spikers side.\n\nIn Game 1 where Ateneo trampled La Salle in four sets, Valdez put up 16 points for the Lady Eagles but it was Michelle Morente\ufffd\u0092s game-high 17 and Ahomiro\ufffd\u0092s 16 markers which proved the difference for the Katipunan Avenue-based school. Even on defense and setting, Ateneo had their best game of the season with Denden Lazaro and Julia Morado delivering the goods.\n\nIt was a total turnaround in the next game as La Salle avenged its Game 1 loss with a four-setter triumph. As expected, Valdez turned in a standard 15 points but she was the only Lady Eagle who finished in double-digit scoring.\n\nElla de Jesus and Amy Ahomiro did manage to contribute nine points each but it was not enough against Galang\ufffd\u0092s 17, and Reyes and Marano\ufffd\u0092s 11 points apiece \ufffd\u0096 which included the telling hits down the line.\n\nOn Wednesday, La Salle has a golden opportunity to rewrite history books as the Lady Spikers are looking more and more composed as the series progresses. They should be wary, however, of the gritty Ateneo side who are not strangers to do-or-die scenarios. The Lady Eagles have gone 0-2 against coach Ramil de Jesus\ufffd\u0092 wards and endured National University\ufffd\u0092s twice-to-beat advantage in the semifinals. And La Salle definitely is next on their radar.",
